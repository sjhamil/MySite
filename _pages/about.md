## Hello, and welcome!

My name is Stephanie Hamilton, and I am a PhD candidate and NSF
Graduate Research Fellow in Physics at the University of Michigan.


My research primarily concerns the search for and discovery of small members of
our Solar System that orbit farther out than Neptune. This region of the Solar
System is called the "[Kuiper Belt]." There's a lot of interest in studying this
region because it has remained largely untouched since the Solar System reached
essentially its present state. This means we can study these objects, what
they're made of, and how they orbit the Sun to figure out what the very early Solar
System looked like (I'm talking even the pre-Earth Solar System) and how it has
evolved over the past 4.5 billion years.

At the moment, I am
studying the characteristics of the longest-period objects we know about, which
are clustered in physical space in an unexpected way. One explanation for this
clustering is [Planet Nine](http://www.findplanetnine.com), a hypothetical new planet
orbiting many times farther out than Neptune or Pluto that could be responsible for
shepherding these long-period objects into their current configuration. The jury
is still out as to whether the evidence is strong enough to definitively say
whether or not Planet Nine exists. I'm hoping that my graduate school research
will be another enlightening voice in the debate.


I am a member of the [Dark Energy Survey], a 500+
member global collaboration. We are currently taking hundreds of thousands of
images of the Southern Hemisphere sky using a sophisticated camera (the [Dark
Energy Camera]) mounted on the 4-meter Blanco Telescope in Chile. While designed
primarily to study very distant galaxies, it turns out that taking pictures of
a huge area of sky also returns lots of Solar System objects. DES is an
extremely powerful Solar System survey despite being designed for extragalactic
science, and I hope to use this incredible data set to learn more about the
history of our Solar System!
