Just...wow. I feel like I've been saying this for the past several years with
all of the amazing traveling I've been fortunate to do during my physics career,
but this was honestly one of the coolest experiences I've had. There are simply
no words to describe witnessing a total solar eclipse, but I'll try my best
anyway!

I've witnessed a couple of partial eclipses in the past, but being present for a
total solar eclipse was a top item on my bucket list. I had been anticipating
the eclipse of August 21, 2017 for *years,* and I knew I had to be in the path
of totality when the time finally came. Everything seemed to fall perfectly into
place within the last few months leading up to the eclipse (and the last year,
really) -- my boyfriend's best friend moved to Seattle to take a job at SpaceX,
my cousin moved to central Oregon within an hour's drive of the path of
totality, and the eclipse was due to happen within a week of both my and my
boyfriend's birthdays. Honestly, I think the universe would have struck me down
if I *hadn't* booked a trip to the Pacific Northwest!

## Stop #1: Seattle, Washington

My boyfriend and I began our Pacific Northwest tour with four days in Seattle,
complete with walking around the city, a baseball game, museums, and hiking. Our
Seattle hosts showed us around Pike Place Market during our first afternoon in the
city after treating us to a delicious brunch. Afterward, we headed to the
Starbucks Roastery (of course I had to get fresh Starbucks coffee in
Seattle!). The rest of the day was spent enjoying ice cream and good drinks
before heading to a Mariners baseball game. Our weekend concluded with  another
delicious brunch, a tour of the
(outside of the) SpaceX complex in Redmond, WA, and exploring the flight museum.

While our hosts worked during the day on Monday and Tuesday, my boyfriend and I
took the opportunity to do some touristy things in Seattle: go up in the Space
Needle, walk through the Chihuly Glass Museum, and see the Olympic Sculpture
Park. After a 13+ mile day of walking, naturally we then had to do a four-mile
hike to Rattlesnake Ledge the following day, in the mountains outside of
Seattle. Even though our
feet were screaming at us a bit, the hike was definitely worth it and the view
from the ledge was fantastic!

We spent a final night with our hosts in Seattle before picking up a rental car
and making the 6 hour drive down to Bend, OR, where we would stay with my cousin
and prepare for the eclipse!


## Stop #2: Bend, Oregon

What better way to spend a couple of days in Bend than touring breweries?
Unfortunately, we didn't get to traverse the infamous "Bend Ale Trail," though
we did check off a few of the breweries on the list during our dinner
outings. During our two days in Bend, however, while my cousin and her boyfriend were
working, my boyfriend and I took advantage of the endless outdoorsy options for
things to do. Our first day was spent hiking in Smith Rock State Park (after
sleeping in quite a bit in the morning...). Let me tell you, the Misery Ridge
Trail lived up to its name. Luckily we chose to hike the correct direction
around the loop -- we conquered the bulk of the difficult climbing at
the beginning and enjoyed a relatively easy and
leisurely hike around the ridge and back down the other side. I definitely would
not have wanted to hike in the other direction! Anyway, the views were amazing:

The first half of our second day in Bend was spent at the Lava Lands National
Park, where we toured the awesome site of a volcanic eruption dated to around
7,000 years ago. Even after all that time, there is still hardly anything living
in the basalt fields! We then rode a shuttle to the rim of the volcanic cinder
cone, where wildlife still existed and the huge, vast expanse of the lava field was
visible. Sort of. Unfortunately, smoke from the Milli Wildfire in Sisters, OR
had been blown directly over where we were. Not only did the smoke partly
conceal what was surely an awesome view, but it also made it hard to breathe. We
returned back to Bend to take a nice float down the Deschutes River in a tube,
and then it was time to pack for our journey to the path of totality! (...that
would make a great movie title!)

## In the Path of Totality

The reality of the solar eclipse didn't truly start to set in for me until the
four of us officially set out from Bend on Saturday, August 19th to secure a
campsite in the path of totality. I could feel my excitement building up, and
that feeling didn't go away for the subsequent few days. We wound our way
through the Oregon high desert, heading north and east out of the smoke cloud
emanating from the Milli Wildfire near Bend. Our destination was Hamilton, OR,
in honor of my cousin's and my last names! Unfortunately, Hamilton was quite a
bit farther than we originally anticipated, so we stopped early and were
fortunate enough to secure one of the last campsites at a county park near
Fossil, OR.

After a full week of exploring (for my boyfriend and I) and work (for my cousin
and her boyfriend), we were pretty content with relaxing and being disconnected
from the busy world outside of our campsite. We spent the subsequent day and a
half lying in our hammocks or chatting around the picnic table, with a short
break to hike up a nearby hill and scope out our viewing spot for the
eclipse. The hike was made considerably more interesting by the fact that it
went through a cattle range -- the cowpies were practically endless!

We were up and moving bright and early at 8am on August 21st. While the partial
phase of the eclipse didn't start until after 9am and the hike up the hill only
took about 20 minutes, I couldn't wait to get up there! Though, of course, once
we were finally at our viewing spot the subsequent hour-long wait was a bit
painful...but with eclipse glasses in hand, we started watching the sun for
signs of the moon's shadow.

### The Eclipse

During the first third of the partial phase (about 20 minutes), there was
practically no difference on Earth aside from the fact that there was a very
obvious chunk of the sun missing when viewed through the eclipse glasses. Then,
however, the air began to feel a bit cooler and the wind started to pick up. The
changing temperature was particularly noticeable in the desert because of the
lack of humidity in the air. By the final 20 minutes of the partial phase, it
was becoming quite chilly and my eyes could discern a very slight darkening of
the world around me. The sensation is difficult to describe -- it almost felt as
if something was a bit "off" with my eyes, like they weren't quite working
properly. It continued to get cooler as the moon continued to slide over the
face of the sun, while the sky remained ever so slightly darker than a bright
day.

The last five minutes (read: *five minutes!*) of the partial phase were
incredible, second only to the minute and a half of totality itself. During
these five minutes, we could watch the last bit of the crescent sun sliding away
(through our glasses, of course). Things began to feel very eery as the world
prepared for sunset at 10:30am -- in those moments, I completely understood why
solar eclipses have the reputation they do in ancient stories. It must have been
terrifying to witness the sky darken and the sun blink out in the middle of the
day! The sky quickly grew noticeably darker as the temperature continued to
drop. In the last moments before totality, we easily spotted Venus shining
brightly overhead. I put on my glasses one last time to watch the last sliver of
the sun disappear...

The scene that met my eyes when I removed my glasses is burned forever into my
memory. The sky had taken on a bluish-black color characteristic of late
evening, while the reds and oranges of sunset were visible around the full 360
degrees of the horizon. But most amazing of all was the sun -- it was covered
completely by the impossibly black disk of the moon, leaving the white, wispy
corona to shine brilliantly in a beautiful halo against the blue-black sky. I
couldn't take my eyes away from it.

All too soon, a mere 90 seconds later, the famous "diamond ring" reappeared: the
sun was returning, with its light overwhelming the corona and the black disk of
the moon in a matter of seconds. My cousin, me, and our boyfriends all turned
toward each other with expressions of "That was amazing!" written on our
faces. To be honest, it was considerably more than "amazing." I wasn't kidding
when I said there aren't words to describe it! There is simply no comparison
between a total eclipse and a partial eclipse -- during a parital eclipse, you
never get the drastic darkening of the sky, the experience of seeing stars
during the day, the overwhelming excitement caused by knowing what these eery
phenomena are leading to, or the image of a black moon surrounded by the
brilliant white corona. All I can say is that I will definitely be in the path
of totatilty for the next total eclipse in the US in April 2024, and you should
be too!
