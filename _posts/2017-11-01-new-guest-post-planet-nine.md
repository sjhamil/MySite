I recently had the exciting opportunity to write a [blog
post](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2017/1030-planet-nine-debate-history.html)
for Emily
Lakdawalla of [The Planetary Society](http://www.planetary.org/)!

The post summarizes a session at the recent meeting of the American Astronomical
Society's Division of Planetary Science in Provo, Utah. Specifically, the
session was all about the mysterious (and still hypothetical) new
planet proposed in the outer solar system. To learn more, go check out the post!
