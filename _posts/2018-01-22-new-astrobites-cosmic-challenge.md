My [new
post](https://astrobites.org/2018/01/22/time-delay-lens-modeling-challenge/)
over on [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) is live!

The paper I wrote about
outlines a challenge for astronomers to produce the best code possible for
estimating the [local expansion
rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law) of the universe (also called
H<sub>0</sub>). Challengers will start with samples of
[gravitationally-lensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_gravitational_lensing)
galaxies, and from those they'll have to work out the H<sub>0</sub> of each
sample. Only the challenge creators know what the right answer is! The ultimate
goal of this challenge is to create the best code possible ahead of
[LSST](https://www.lsst.org/), which
is going to produce an unimaginable amount of data during its 10-year run.

Go take a read, and let me know what you think!
