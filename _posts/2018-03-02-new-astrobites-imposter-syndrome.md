I wrote a [new
post](https://astrobites.org/2018/03/02/overcoming-the-imposter-syndrome/) for
[Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) that went live today!

This post covers a topic that I've struggled a lot with and that is very common
among graduate students: imposter syndrome. That voice in your head telling you
you're not good enough, not qualified, just "faking it" through everything. This
post was inspired by Valerie Young's book ["The Secret Thoughts of Successful
Women."](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Thoughts-Successful-Women-Impostor/dp/0307452719). In
it, I summarize some of the ways imposter syndrome can manifest and what you can
do to start tackling that inner voice.

Do you suffer from imposter syndrome? Let's all spread some anti-imposter love
