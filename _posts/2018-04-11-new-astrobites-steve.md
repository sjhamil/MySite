My [new post](https://astrobites.org/2018/04/11/lets-call-it-steve/) for
[Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) is now live!

This one was fun to write, partly because the naming of this phenomenon is one of
my favorite stories. If you've ever seen the 2006 movie "Over the Hedge" you
might remember [the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amwaFNZYUUY) where
the animals first encounter the big, scary
hedge. To make it less scary, they name it Steve. Now fast-forward to 2016, when
some amateur astronomers in northern Canada spotted a new, unknown type of
aurora. For lack of a better name, they called it "Steve" in the spirit of the
2006 movie.

Now, STEVE stands for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. That's a lot
of words that probably don't mean much, but over the past two years we've come
to realize that STEVE isn't actually a typical aurora. Instead, it's something
called a "subauroral ion drift", or SAID. SAIDs are usually produced during
auroral storms, but instead of arising from interactions of the solar wind with
Earth's magnetic field, they are short-lived events produced by supersonic flows
of ions and plasma in the atmosphere.

STEVE is really cool, and also has a pretty cool name. Go read the post and let
me know what you think!
