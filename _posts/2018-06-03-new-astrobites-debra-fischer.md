Another day, another [new
post](https://astrobites.org/2018/06/03/meet-the-aas-keynote-speakers-debra-fischer/)
over on [Astrobites!](https://astrobites.org)

This was a different kind of piece than I've ever done before. Most things I've
written have been summaries -- of a conference, of a paper, of something I
read. But this time, I got to interview the inspiring Debra Fischer, who is
trying to find new Earth-like planets around other stars. I had so much fun
talking to her!

Not only is she a successful #womaninSTEM, but her story is simply inspiring. Go
take a read!
