Yet another post for [Astrobites!](https://astrobites.org)

This one is another interview of a keynote speaker at the upcoming American
Astronomical Society meeting in Denver, CO. I got to talk to Keivan Stassun
about his work studying exoplanets and about his inspiring work on
neurodiversity. He was such a fun person to talk to, and I hope you'll check out
the post!
