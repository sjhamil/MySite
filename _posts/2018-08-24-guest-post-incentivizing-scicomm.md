I recently wrote a [blog
post](https://blog.ucsusa.org/science-blogger/bringing-communication-back-into-science-incentivizing-scicomm-efforts-for-early-career-scientists)
for the [Union of Concerned Scientists](https://www.ucsusa.org/) as part of their
annual Early Career Scientists (ECS) Month. As an ECS myself, and as a passionate
science communicator, I knew exactly what I wanted to write about -- providing
more incentives for ECS to participate in science communication and outreach.

Nowadays, it's incredibly hard to "make it" in the academic world -- you need to
spend upwards of 60 of 70 hours working every week and publish lots of
papers. All of that means there's less time for other enjoyable activities, like
outreach. Currently, many positions in the academic track don't credit outreach
work. In fact, that time spent on outreach might ultimately penalize you because
you ended up publishing fewer papers in the end! I strongly believe that
outreach work should be rewarded and encouraged, at the very least to give back
to the people whose tax dollars we're using to do our work.
