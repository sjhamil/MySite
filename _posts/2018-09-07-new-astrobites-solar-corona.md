My [latest post](https://astrobites.org/2018/09/07/corralling-the-solar-corona/)
for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) is now live!

For the paper I covered, I got to relive a little bit of the amazing experience that was
the 2017 total solar eclipse (I wrote another blog post about it
[here](https://stephaniejhamilton.com/blog/great-american-eclipse/)). Total
solar eclipses provide us with rare opportunities to study parts of the Sun that
are otherwise completely outshone -- namely, the corona. The authors of the
paper used observations of the Sun's magnetic fields in the weeks leading up to
the eclipse to try to predict what the corona would look like on the day of the
eclipse -- in other words, they were trying to predict space weather!

They did
reasonably well, but they also clearly demonstrated that we don't have nearly
enough instruments taking data of the Sun to be able to accurately predict its
weather. But we need to be able to do this, because a powerful solar
storm has the potential to knock out our satellites, electrical grids, and other
various technology we use to survive! With enough advance warning, like that
provided by space weather forecasting, we could mitigate the harmful effects of
a solar storm.
