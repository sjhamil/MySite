I recently spent a week in beautiful (read: gray and rainy) Seattle, WA for the
233rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society. While I did have a science
talk to present, much of my participation at the meeting was as an
[Astrobites](https://astrobites.org) author. I was actually really grateful to
be there as part of Astrobites because this was the largest meeting I had ever
been to. It was nice to have a "home base" at the Astrobites booth amid the
3000-person conference.

### Interviewing the keynote speakers

Prior to the meeting, I was part of a team that interviewed some of the
meeting's keynote speakers. We then wrote up those interviews with the goal of
advertising the keynote talk in addition to highlighting the scientist and the
various career paths they took. I had the pleasure of speaking to Drs. Colleen
Wilson-Hodge, Alexander Szalay, and Elena Aprile.
* **Colleen Wilson-Hodge** is the Principal Investigator of the Fermi
  Telescope's Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. She was awarded the High Energy
  Astrophysics Division's Rossi Prize for her leadership and team's
  contributions to the first-ever binary neutron star discovery. Read my post

* **Alexander Szalay**
  is a professor at Johns Hopkins who specializes in storing huge data sets and
  making them easily accessible to both scientists and members of the
  public. His next big challenge is figuring out how to securely store the 15
  petabytes of data that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will produce. Read

* **Elena Aprile**
  is the spokesperson of the XENON dark matter direct detection experiment,
  buried deep under a mountain in Italy. She won the Society's Berkeley prize
  and delivered the final plenary lecture of the meeting about the future of
  dark matter experiments. Read my post

### Live-blogging the meeting sessions

During the meeting, I was part of the Astrobites live-blogging team. As a group,
we wrote summaries of the major sessions during each day of the meeting,
including the plenary talks, press conferences, and other interesting special
sessions. You can find those summaries here: [Day
1](https://astrobites.org/2019/01/08/astrobites-at-aas-233-day-1/), [Day
2](https://astrobites.org/2019/01/09/astrobites-at-aas-233-day-2/), [Day
3](https://astrobites.org/2019/01/10/astrobites-at-aas-233-day-3/), [Day
4](https://astrobites.org/2019/01/12/astrobites-at-aas-233-day-4/) (to read
my summaries, just do a browser search for my name).

Overall, the meeting was a great success! I'm looking forward to attending the
Summer 2019 meeting in St. Louis, where I'm also helping to organize a science
communication training workshop for student attendees. Stay tuned!
