It's been a minute, but I have another [new
post](https://astrobites.org/2019/04/01/distances-in-the-dark-using-binary-black-holes-to-study-the-universes-expansion/)
up on
[Astrobites!](https://astrobites.org/)


This latest post describes how some talented colleagues of mine, Marcelle
Soares-Santos and Antonella Palmese, led efforts to measure how fast the
universe is expanding using the collision of two black holes measured by
[LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/about). This is an important
measurement because this particular method is completely independent of other
previous methods. Previous methods have relied on electromagnetic signals, such
as from a specific type of supernova (Type Ia) or the Cosmic Microwave
Background, but these methods are currently in tension with each
other. Measuring the expansion rate of the universe using binary black holes
will be able to tell us which, if either is right!

Unfortunately, the authors only had one event to work with, but they show that
with 100 events, binary black hole collisions will be an equally powerful way to
measure the expanding universe as current methods!
