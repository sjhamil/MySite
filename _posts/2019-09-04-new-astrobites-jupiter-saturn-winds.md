Here's a [new
post](https://astrobites.org/2019/09/04/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-wind-2/)
for [Astrobites!](https://astrobites.org/). The authors of today's paper used
gravity measurements from the NASA missions Juno and Cassini (orbiting Jupiter
and Saturn, respectively) to calculate how deep winds penetrate into each
planet. Read the full post to find out how they did it!
