        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.stephaniejhamilton.com/blog/astronomy-telescopes-bears-part-1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;….ok, I never actually saw the bear….but we were thoroughly warned before
(and after) we arrived at the mountain that there was a resident black bear
roaming the premises. And I can confirm that the bear was sighted during the
time we were there, though not by anyone in our group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This May, I had the fantastic opportunity to travel to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noao.edu/kpno/&quot;&gt;Kitt Peak National
Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, located about 50 miles southwest of
Tucson, AZ, to teach a great 
group of undergraduates about ground-based observatories. Over the course of
four short weeks, the students developed a science idea to test, wrote a
telescope observing proposal based on that idea, took their own data using
two telescopes at Kitt Peak, reduced and analyzed the data, and presented
their results. And this was all done while having to sit in lectures, go
on tours (both on the Kitt Peak site and off), and participate in several other
off-site excursions! Thinking back, it’s really amazing how much the students
were able to accomplish, and to such a high standard! (Can you tell I’m proud of
them?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an instructor, I was fortunate enough to get an all-expenses-paid
trip (plus a paycheck!) to a gorgeous mountaintop with greenery and wildlife,
awesome telescopes, and beautiful sunsets. It was probably the best experience
I’ve had in graduate school so far, so I am writing this blog post to
memorialize it and share it with all of you! I’ll be splitting this experience
into several posts, due to the jam-packed schedule and sheer number of
things we were able to do and see over the course of our month at Kitt Peak. So
stay tuned for subsequent posts in this series!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and make sure you check out my photos, too!  &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-long-arrow-right&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sunday-may-7th&quot;&gt;Sunday, May 7th&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pretty smooth travels (aside from a two hour delay in Minneapolis) I
FINALLY arrived in Tucson! This was my first time in Southern Arizona, so I was
excited to see this new place. Of course, the first thing I noticed was all of
the brown – brown ground, brown trees, brown weeds….and then Sally (the
professor of the class) said as we were driving up Kitt Peak the first time,
“Wow, it’s pretty green here still!”…WHAT? After she said it, I could see some
green in there,
but coming from Michigan pretty much anything else seems brown by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students were assigned dorm rooms in pairs, while Sally and I would be
staying in the guest house on site. Accommodations were basically what you’d
expect from a facility constructed in 
the 1960s – wood paneled walls, fluffy carpet, a single ethernet modem that was
very obviously wired after the house was built….not even kidding, there was an
obvious hole in the exterior wall. Nonetheless, I was happy to be staying in a
place with my own bedroom, a kitchen, and internet access (evidently the dorm
where the students stayed didn’t even have ethernet! #firstworldproblems?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After settling in a bit, we all piled
into our giant 15-passenger van (a completely necessary vehicle with 12 students
and 2 instructors, thankfully I didn’t have to drive it) and headed to one of
the two telescopes we would be using the following weekend (the
Hiltner 2.4-meter and the McGraw-Hill 1.3-meter) to shadow an
astronomer who was using it for the night. It was actually super cool to see
astronomy behind-the-scenes on the very first night at the observatory! We
didn’t hang around too long though, due to our jet-lagged brains screaming at us
for being awake at (what felt like) 3am…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/KPNO17/mayall_bw.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The Mayall 4m, KPNO.&quot; alt=&quot;The Mayall 4m, KPNO.&quot; style=&quot;width: 60%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday-may-8th&quot;&gt;Monday, May 8th&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1 of class was pretty uneventful, with a general introduction to the site and the
structure of the class. In general, each day consisted of an AM, PM, and evening
activity – these consisted primarily of lectures and site tours toward the
beginning, but transitioned to more off-site excursions toward the end. More
on those later! We were welcomed to the observatory by none other than the
director herself, Lori Allen (side note: how awesome is it that the director of
a major American astronomical observatory is a woman?!). We learned from her the
difficulties that come with funding an observatory whose largest telescopes are
now considered painfully mid-sized, and all of the hoops they need to jump
through. The National Science Foundation was actually about to close this
historic and beautiful observatory until its largest telescope was chosen to be
used for a huge upcoming survey,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy_Spectroscopic_Instrument&quot;&gt;DESI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday-may-9th&quot;&gt;Tuesday, May 9th&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 was a bit more interesting than Day 1, with tours to two of the bigger
telescopes on site planned – the 2.3-meter WIYN telescope and the 4-meter
Mayall telescope (where DESI will be installed). These two scopes are quite
different in their designs; for example, the Mayall lives in an 18-story
concrete/metal building, while the WIYN lives in a 4 story building….this has
to do primarily with the way the telescopes are mounted and controlled. In the
old days before advanced computers, it was much easier to align one of the telescope’s
axes of motion with Earth’s axis of rotation. This way, when an astronomer was
tracking an object across the sky, she only had to worry about a single axis of
rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with this design is that by having one axis aligned with Earth’s
rotational axis, one ends up with the weight of the telescope somewhat suspended
in midair. Consequently, the supports for the telescope need to be much bigger
in order to securely support its weight. A better design is one that
doesn’t have to fight gravity as 
much – instead, have one axis be horizontal to the ground (like a
merry-go-round) and have the second axis be a simple up-and-down 
movement. Unfortunately, this design was not practical until more advanced
computers came along that could precisely control the two axes simultaneously in order
to track an object across the sky. Now that that’s possible, however, telescopes
built today use this second design. The pictures below show these two designs:
on the left is the first and on the right is the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/KPNO17/mayall_mount.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 53%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot; alt=&quot;The Mayall 4m, KPNO&quot; title=&quot;The Mayall 4m, KPNO&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the rest of the day with a couple of lectures and a meal in the
cafeteria. I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the
food up at the summit – I had heard horror stories about the cafeteria-grade food
by some colleagues, but
I enjoyed every meal throughout the month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday-may-10th&quot;&gt;Wednesday, May 10th&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think by the third day, the students were starting to become aware of the work
that would be required of them during the month…this was the day they needed
to choose a telescope on-site that they would write five pages about, with only a couple of
days until their project observing proposals were due, complete from choosing a
topic to study to determining the amount
of time and the instruments they would need on the telescopes to describing the science
product they expected to obtain at the end. Let’s just say I much preferred the
instructor role, available to help when needed but also able to sit under a tree
with a book when I wanted…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we had the chance to head over to one of telescopes we’d be
using in just a couple of days, the McGraw-Hill 1.3-meter at the
MDM observatory
(fun fact: “MDM” stands for MIT, Dartmouth, and Michigan, in honor of the
founding institutions of this subset of telescopes. MIT has since left the
collaboration, and the remaining institutions have been joined by Ohio State,
Ohio University, and Columbia University. Yet it’s still called
MDM…astronomers, I tell ya). Was this the start of our observing run? No,
actually we were going to watch an astronomer at the University of Michigan
begin his night of observing from the comfort of his own office. This “remote
observing” is quite bizarre to witness – imagine you’re sitting in a room
surrounded by the computers that control the telescope, yet the mouse is moving
on its own, the lights in the dome turn on and off by themselves, and the
telescope just starts moving….yes, obviously there was a human controlling
these things, but it was strange knowing they were doing so from 2,000 miles away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday-may-11th&quot;&gt;Thursday, May 11th&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday was a pretty chill day overall, at least for Sally and I. For the
students, it was a combination of stressful in the morning as they put the
finishing touches on their observing proposal drafts and relaxation/decompression
after said stress. The afternoon saw a brief lecture from me, but the evening is
when the real fun started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We piled into our 15-passenger van once again (this became a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; common
theme throughout the month…I had a love/hate relationship with that van) and
made our way to the MDM observatory to get familiar with the instruments we’d be
using. We of course watched the
sunset before getting to work, as all astronomers do (what can we say, they
never get old!). I’ve come to the conclusion that no sunset compares to those
seen from mountain tops in the desert – the reddened sunlight just mixes so
perfectly with the dusty brown/red landscape, and mountains are always gorgeous
photo targets. I have no idea how many sunset pictures I took over the course of
the month, but this one has to be my favorite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/KPNO17/sunset_pano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sunset at MDM&quot; title=&quot;Sunset at MDM&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sunset, we began standard procedures to prepare the telescopes for a
night of observing. We weren’t officially scheduled to begin observing until
Friday night, but we wanted to be familiar with the instruments and procedures
before we actually had to do it for real. I took the helm at the 1.3m, while
Sally was in control at the 2.4m. The start up and shut down procedures became
second nature by the end of our four nights at the scopes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill the detector dewar with liquid nitrogen in order to keep it cold all
night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open exterior doors to the dome to equilibrate the air temperature inside the
dome and reduce turbulence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the dome shutter, then open the telescope mirror covers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open any field stops to ensure light can reach the detector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tell the telescope to begin tracking Earth’s rotation. Then, move to a bright
star and ensure the telescope is pointing where it thinks it is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Observe!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform 1–5 in reverse to shut down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was after 2am by the time we had ironed out any kinks in the procedures and
gained confidence in operating the telescopes, so with an unplanned half-night
of observing under our belts, we went to bed eagerly anticipating our full
weekend of observing ahead. Or, at least, I was – I’ve come to really enjoy
staying up all night in the peaceful company of other astronomers and with the
ability to go outside and see incredible night skies whenever I want. Maybe I’m
crazy, or maybe I’m just meant to be an astronomer. There’s
nothing like it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday-may-12th--monday-may-15th&quot;&gt;Friday, May 12th – Monday, May 15th&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray, it was finally observing weekend! Granted, we had literally all of
Friday to get through first, and maybe I was the only one actually excited about
staying up all night to operate a multi-million-dollar instrument, but I think
the students were eager as well….at the very least to operate said
instruments. After submitting final drafts of their observing proposals and a
lecture from me, and after arming ourselves with snacks and coffee, we were
ready for our first full night of observing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watched sunset, as per usual, and then dispersed to our selected telescopes
– I was again in charge of the smaller 1.3m telescope, while the majority of the
students opted to use the 2.4m. Aside from being bigger, the 2.4m had different
instruments installed that would perform spectroscopy (essentially decomposing
all of the light from a source into the amount of light per wavelength), which
most of the students’ projects required. This all meant that my job was actually
pretty easy! Things went smoothly the whole night, at least at the 1.3m, and I
was glad that the first 
observing experience (ever, for some of the students) went so well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up around 5:30am (I know, crazy), and then slept until the next
afternoon. I always feel extremely lazy when observing because I wake up at 2pm
or later, even though I stay up until 5:30 or 6am…I’m a night owl for sure,
but definitely not nocturnal! Anyway, Saturday afternoon was our mock Telescope
Allocation Committee (TAC)…even though we had observed already…oh well, the
schedule can always be adjusted! The purpose of the TAC is to evaluate all
observing proposals submitted, discuss strengths and weaknesses along with the
impact of each, and then give each proposal an overall score. In our class, the top-ranked
proposals then got the amount of time at the time of night they requested, while
the lower-ranked proposals did not get all of the time they asked for (in the
real world, the bottom-ranked proposals don’t get any time at all, if the
telescope gets filled up!). I was incredibly impressed with the level of the
discussions by the students about each proposal – Sally even said that it was
at the level of a real TAC! Our observing schedule was modified slightly based
on the evaluations of our mock TAC, and then it was nap time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday night went pretty much exactly how Friday went – gorgeous sunset,
smooth observing, watched a couple of movies (animated Pixar films, obviously!), and
wrapped up around 6am. After waking up in the mid-afternoon on Sunday, I decided
it was about time I explored the summit a bit, so I took my book and set off to
find the perfect secluded reading spot. And oh, did I find it! Look at this
view! I definitely went back here several times during the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/KPNO17/pano_mcgrath_elderbrother.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The view looking south from the Kitt Peak summit.&quot; alt=&quot;The view looking south from the Kitt Peak summit.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday night was much more of the same, and again we slept until
mid-afternoon on Monday. I was so glad our observing runs went so incredibly
smoothly! That all too often seems not to be the case, whether it’s because of
some technical failure, a software error, or just Mother Nature. After a lecture
and dinner, we all had Monday night off 
and were able to finally try to adjust back to normal sleeping hours. This is
actually starting to become second nature to me…every time I go observing, it
seems like I adjust to the opposite schedule even faster than the last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think I’ll wrap this post up here. I hope you’re enjoying reading about my
Kitt Peak adventure so far! I’ll be back soon with the next post in this series,
in which we actually get to leave the mountain after 10 straight days on the
summit. Though to be honest, I was quite happy to return to 6750 feet after only
a short time in the desert heat…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until my next post, friends!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello!</title>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.stephaniejhamilton.com/blog/hello/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m Stephanie, a high-energy-physicist-turned-astronomer working toward my
Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. I’ve had a non-linear path to becoming an
astronomer, even though astronomy has been my passion since about the sixth
grade. Better late than never, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to find myself studying the Solar System, and more specifically the
small objects that orbit within a donut-shaped ring farther out than Neptune. While
this isn’t what I’d pictured myself studying when I began graduate school, I
honestly wouldn’t want to be studying anything else! These small, seemingly
insignificant bodies in the distant reaches of the Solar System actually hold
the key to unlocking its entire history! The much larger gas giant planets
easily fling them about, so by discovering many of them and watching how they
move, we can try to make educated guesses as to what types of interactions
happened in their pasts. I think that’s what I find so cool and
exciting about my research – we are pushing the limits of the best telescopes
and cameras on Earth to search for objects that are a fraction of the size of
Earth and farther away than Pluto or the New Horizons spacecraft. It’s truly amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my time so far in graduate school, I’ve become really passionate
about science education and public outreach and the importance of giving back to
one’s community by passing on knowledge. I love talking to people about science,
whether it be my own work or something completely unrelated. Science (but
especially astronomy….though I may be biased :D ) is just so cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked hard over the past several months to create this website and blog so
I can share my passion and 
excitement for science (mainly astronomy, but probably some other cool things
too!) with all of you. I’ve also created a travel blog to document my travels to
wherever astronomy takes me around the world (starting now….as my family and
friends already know, I’ve been several places already, including Chile and
several European countries…). You can get to both of these from the “Blogs”
tab at the top of the site. I hope you’ll find my blogs interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much love, &lt;br /&gt;
~Stephanie~&lt;/p&gt;
